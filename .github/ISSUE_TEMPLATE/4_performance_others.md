## Details

<!--
1.  Please tell us exactly how to reproduce the problem you are running into, and how you measured the performance.

2.  Switch CCCaster to main channel and run this app on a physical device
     using profile or release mode. Verify that the performance issue can be
     reproduced there.

     The bleeding edge main channel is encouraged here because CCCaster is
     constantly fixing bugs and improving its performance. Your problem in an
     older CCCaster version may have already been solved in the main channel.
