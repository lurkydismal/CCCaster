<!-- Thank you for using CCCaster!

     If you are looking for support, please check out our documentation:
          - https://github.com/lurkydismal/CCCaster/wiki

     If you have found a performance problem, then fill out the template below.
     Please read our guide to filing a bug first: https://github.com/lurkydismal/CCCaster/wiki/bug-reports

## Details

<!--
1.  Please tell us exactly how to reproduce the problem you are running into.

2.  Switch CCCaster to main channel and run this app on a physical device
     using as follows:
       CCCaster upgrade main
       CCCaster analyze

     The bleeding edge main channel is encouraged here because CCCaster is
     constantly fixing bugs and improving its performance. Your problem in an
     older CCCaster version may have already been solved in the main channel.

4.  Record a video of the performance issue using another phone so we
     can have an intuitive understanding of what happened. Donâ€™t use
     "adb screenrecord", as that affects the performance of the profile run.

<!--
     Please tell us which target platform(s) the problem occurs (Android / iOS / Web / macOS / Linux / Windows)
     Which target OS version, for Web, browser, is the test system running?
     Does the problem occur on emulator/simulator as well as on physical devices?
